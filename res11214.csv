Brent came to our house and it was clear he had a lot of experience as he not only gave us a very fair bid  he also offered good suggestions on color schemes and paint finishes. Our house needed quite a bit of caulking and prep work  as the last company that painted our house used sub-par paint which started to peal  causing minor water damage to our wood. Brent took the time to caulk the problem areas and fix the existing problems. Brent and his crew used top quality paint  paid great attention to detail and did not rush through the job. Brent was reliable and honest and a pleasure to work with. I am very happy with Final Stroke Painting's work and highly reccomend them. -Scott Schwartz (Maple Grove  MN) Deals:  $1 600 interior painting deal (walls only on up to 1600 sq ft house  closets $50 extra ea)  $3 000 interior painting deal (walls only on up to 3 500 sq ft house  closets $50/extra ea)  $2 300 Exterior 2 tone painting deal (up to a 1 800 sq ft house)  $3 300 Exterior 2 tone painting deal ( up to a 2 600 sq ft house)  $1 500 cabinet refinishing deal ( includes up to 60 drawers and doors)  Call to set up a free walkthrough today to see if you quality for our specials.

If you're serious about playing guitar  stop by and say hi!  TESTIMONIALS  ""In 2019  I took several 1-hour lessons from Ed Levy  master Broadway guitarist/teacher. Ed is based in New York City; I live in San Diego; so  naturally  we used SKYPE to conduct our lessons. SKYPE worked out great. It allowed me to avail myself of Ed‚Äôs musical expertise  something I couldn‚Äôt get face-to-face here in San Diego. The value of Ed‚Äôs lessons was inestimable. As a classical guitarist/composer  I was interested in learning more music theory so I could better understand the nature of my instrument. Ed‚Äôs lessons did not disappoint! Not only did I learn the 5 major scale patterns in 5 keys and was given the major  4-note root position chord voicings  but Ed‚Äôs enthusiasm for the entire jazz genre ignited a spark in me that has now led to a lifelong interest in the jazz idiom. I can‚Äôt wait to resume my lessons with Ed.  Jerry K.  classical guitarist / San Diego  CA  ""I studied with Ed Levy while working on my Bachelor's Degree. He has helped me tremendously in the areas that would have otherwise been very daunting and difficult to learn  such as arranging chord-melody solos  learning to play over difficult chord changes  transcribing and analyzing solos  to name a few. Ed has helped me with understanding music theory  fretboard knowledge  and selection of good repertoire. He also instilled the love and appreciation of Classical Guitar playing. Ed is a very high-caliber musician  and has a wealth of knowledge of modern concepts of approaching harmony and rhythm.   Peter K.  guitarist/music teacher  Master's of Music Degree Program  ""Ed is a phenomenal teacher. I began with no musical knowledge at all. I did not know how to hold a guitar or a pick and today my guitar is a daily joy. The amount Ed taught me is amazing. I now have rhythm  an understanding of musical theory and structure  can read and write music and can hear music in an entirely different way as well as being able to play with friends.  Glenn M.  ""I am a video/audio engineer and programmer for a large A/V integrator as well as a guitarist/vocalist currently with Lenox Underground  a classic rock cover band based in Summit NJ. I have studied with Ed Levy for several years  mainly in 1-2 hour-long sessions in private or by Skype. Ed Levy is an accomplished and amazing player  as well as a consummate music teacher. The musical devices and knowledge he has picked up along his career path have all been compiled and polished as an effective and speedy track to better playing.   Brian H.  guitar/vocals/engineer & programmer (Diversified US)  ""Ed Levy is great  he was my first guitar teacher at UT  and taught me what is now my favorite chord (V7sus4b9).This dude got my classical chops from Snowflight to Capricho Arabe  and showed me how to love jazz.   Paul M.  professional guitarist/teacher  ""When I first saw the ad online for this program  I wasn't sure what to expect- linking up over the web is always so hit or miss  but this was definitely a jackpot. As a musician I'm always looking for situations that will strike a balance between pushing my abilities and being a well-run  positive  supportive experience. I feel blessed to have gotten personal attention from a musician who plays at the industry's highest levels in NYC. From Broadway to Bach  Ed has experience with just about every type of music and performance scenario you could imagine.   Nick P.  professional singer/songwriter/guitarist  Ed is an excellent teacher!  Full disclosure: I‚Äôm a professional musician and Ed is my cousin. Occasionally I encounter situations in which i can play my music  but i don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs making it tick. Ed has never failed to explain something to me in a way that enables me to see it in a completely new light. I wish i could pick his brain 24/7!

Minneapolis,,  I have 10 YEARS OF CLEANING EXPERIENCE and have graduated at the top of my class from Anoka Technical College in the Medical Assistant program in December 2010 and have decided to go back to school part time to become an RN.    In the meantime I am providing my cleaning services full time with flexible scheduling. I have had a background check done for school through the MN Dept of Health and Human Services. I also have completed my Associate's Degree in Small Business Management from Ashworth College in 2005.  I have several various appointments available since I am going from part time to full time.  I offer weekly  biweekly  monthly  one time and move out cleaning services.  Pets ok! Love cats and dogs!!  I provide my own cleaning supplies and equipment unless there is something special you would prefer me to use.    Products I use include: Lysol All Purpose Cleaner for floors. For the kitchen I use 409.  For the bathroom I use Clorox Bathroom Cleaner  Clorox Toilet Bowl Cleaner and Windex MultiSurface. I use Pledge and a clean rag to dust.   Instead of using a broom I get on my hands and knees and vacuum with the vacuum hose the uncarpeted floors to ensure I get all the debris. I use a damp microfiber mop and a spray bottle (1 part cleaning solution to 10 part water) to mop. This way of mopping ensures that wooden floors don't absorb too much moisture.   Charging a flat rate of $25/hr (minimum of 3 hours) -- most homes take 3-5 hours to clean.

Fairfax CA,,"  US-Web-Design starts with me  Jeff Napier. I've been building  repairing and publicizing websites since 1995  but I still don't know everything. So  I have assembled a group of US-based experts. If I am not experienced in what you need  I can connect you with the right specialist in the group.  We offer everything from momentary phone advice to complete web construction including custom programming  SEO and social media marketing. The cost can be surprisingly low  often less than overseas outsourcing  but with higher quality and better communication.  The low cost is about experience. We've done what you want many times before. We charge more than the high school kid down the street  but get it done more quickly  get it right the first time  and it ends up costing you less. Sometimes way less! For instance if all you need is a simple one-page website  it can be built for under $100.  On the other end of the spectrum  we can solve your most complex web programming issues. We are often asked to repair hacked and broken WordPress and other websites. Sometimes it takes only minutes. Our smallest invoice was $3.  No doubt you've heard the horror stories of web developers who overcharge  do what they want to do  instead of what you want  take forever  and sometimes can't even complete the job. Then there are the webmasters who won't even give you the passwords to your own website. If anyone in the group was like that  I'd throw them out. In fact  I did expel one member because he didn't treat a client quite right. Everyone is friendly and communicative  yet highly professional.  One member of the group will even build your website up front  before you spend a penny. You only pay once you approve the design.  Perhaps your website doesn't get enough visitors. That can be fixed  too  sometimes spectacularly. My most successful client went from three visitors per month to over 14 000 per day. In a more typical case  a website gained 375 000 unique visitors in four months. There are SEO companies out there that want to charge you hundreds or even thousands of dollars  and the limited things they do don't even work most of the time!  We have two good SEO specialists and a social media marketer that can make a world of difference to your business. They will charge you much less  and are happy to show you all the tricks if you'd like to do it yourself.  Some of our clients like learning to manage their own websites  so they don't need to hire someone for every little change  and because it can be a creative  enjoyable process. I  and some members of the group are happy to offer training by phone and screen sharing.  Call me  Jeff Napier  at (805) 843-5353.  What People Say:  ""I've had a lot of compliments on the website. Thank you!"" Constance   ""I hired Jeff Napier a year ago to assist in some simple website development but seeing his expertise and professionalism I had him take on much larger tasks. Time and time again he proved there was no project he could not handle. Learning how to design and develop websites had always been a goal of mine so I started paying Jeff for coaching and it learned quickly that he is also a talented teacher. He is patient  well spoken  precise and an all-around enjoyable person to work with.  His pricing is fair  his response time is lightning fast and he has forgotten more about web design than most overpriced developers today will ever know. If you need an expertly constructed responsive website  developer coaching  website troubleshooting  website hosting  SEO (Search Engine Optimization)  or anything else web related  there is no company I more highly recommend than US Web Design.""  Adam McKinley Owner True Social Marketing  ""I can't thank you enough for all your help. You have made a huge difference."" Fay Fahron  Columnist  Entrepreneur  ""You just qualified for sainthood. Just to let you know  I have seen a big increase in inquiries from my website."" Ann Flaherty  Private Detective  ""Working with Jeff on my website has been a great experience. Jeff gives personal one on one technical help which is hard to find. When you email or call him you know whom you will be talking with  and not get shuffled off to a random employee.  It's the sort of technical help I have not found in many years. Plus his rates are very reasonable."" Scott Paul ScottPaulDesigns.com  ""I received three franchise inquires after your very first post!"" Sheila McCann  House of Bread  ""I was fortunate enough to find US-Web-Design at the perfect time. I had recently purchased a website working off of WordPress that needed a complete overhaul. Between the two of us  with Jeff of US-Web-Design taking on the technical aspect  the operation is shaping up very nice. Jeff is 100% professional at all times. I have another full time job  it would be impossible to keep things going without his help. I will keep Jeff on board for as long as I can get his help. I consider him part of the team. I 100% recommend US-Web-Design."" Ariane Rezvani  Owner / Trainer Silver Cup Training  ""I'm an ebook author with an income now that never would have happened without your help!"" Amy Butler  ""Thanks so much for explaining it in detail for me. That's exactly what I wanted  and thanks for doing it so quickly. Regards  Sharon""  ""As he [Jeff of US-Web-Design] is a good communicator who is always keen to help  I have no hesitation in saying that any project whether large or small  will benefit from his considerable experience and originality."" Godfrey Gardner  Reedmace Ltd. UK.  ""That was so helpful. Thank you 1 million Jeff and I will keep you in my files for future jobs‚Ä¶ You are very efficient and helpful. Much appreciated. All the best  Miranda""  ""First let me say the help you gave me Sat. was invaluable. The last two days I have had numerous projects that required resizing  compression  and conversion of files from TIFF and PNG to JPG. I would have been totally lost had it not been for your tutorial. THANK YOU!"" Anonymous  ""Lots of compliments on the web site and I will sure direct new business to you!!"" David Starkey  ""Jeff has been a pleasure to work with over the past 3 weeks. From the first time we availed his services he has been very patient and diligent with excellent troubleshooting skills to meet a task. Given the momentous scope of the project we had given him to accomplish  in a very short period of time  we can clearly attest to the fact he went above and beyond our expectation to complete it.

TWIN CITIES & BEYOND,,  RATES STARTING AT 500.00 AND CLUB RATES STARTING 250.00   Please understand if you ask me for a quote  it includes more than just the hours of your event. If you hire me for a five hour event for me that can turn into an eight hour plus day. I have to factor in the time it takes to load my vehicle  the time it takes to drive to the destination  the time it takes to unload. I also have to factor in how much time it takes to setup. All this takes place before the performance.After the performance its the time it takes time to tear down  load my vehicle and drive back to where I store my equipment. I also have to consider gas to get to an event. And further more I have to consider the value of my equipment and the cost depreciation. I own my equipment  and I use the top of the line. A lot of people hiring a DJ do not understand how much work this job entails. Thank you for your time and I appreciate you reading my ad.  Some of the venues that I've have worked at include The Dakota Lodge  Five Event Center  Mn History Center  Gabbies  Zurah Shrine Center  Hamline University  Earle Brown Center Chromonix Golf Course Braemar Golf Course  Edina Country Club  Hastings Country Club  Tonix  and a host of clubs  hotels and VFW's.  I'm a DJ that spins all types of music  from Top 40  Electronic  House  Dancehall  80's  Hip Hop  R & B to Smooth Jazz. I have been a mixer for a local radio station as well as having my own internet radio show. My mixes have also been broadcast across the country and locally. My quote includes time setting up and tearing down  performance and travel time. I can provide wireless mics and lighting.  I've performed at night clubs  bars  weddings  silent auctions  corporate parties   family reunions   retail stores(Macy's  NY & Company  Skethers Victoria's Secret  Louis Vuitton)  fitness classes and private parties.
